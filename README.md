# Proof-of-concept

This repo was auto generated by [rocket](https://rocket.new) by running it on part of an import from a default app project in [figma.com](https://www.figma.com/).
Rocket uses agentic AI to create a working (Android Studio) Flutter project from a Figma import.

Except for a bit basic navigation the imported Figma model has no functionality.

As a new rocket user you can use 1 million tokens for free before you need to pay.
I spend 800k tokens to create a project with just two tabs from the Figma import.
And the remaining 200k tokens was spend on asking rocket to fix an error.

Priced at $20 for 5 million tokens you quickly spend money if you need to do a bigger import.

The dummy project is currently being served by Amazon S3 from http://jespertk-app-export-test.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com

Not https; it's a proof of concept so I didn't bother.

Everything else than this initial text section is created by rocket or otherwise auto generated.

## 🧩 Adding Routes
To add new routes to the application, update the `lib/routes/app_routes.dart` file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:package_name/presentation/home_screen/home_screen.dart';

class AppRoutes {
  static const String initial = '/';
  static const String home = '/home';

  static Map<String, WidgetBuilder> routes = {
    initial: (context) => const SplashScreen(),
    home: (context) => const HomeScreen(),
    // Add more routes as needed
  }
}
```
## 🎨 Theming

This project includes a comprehensive theming system with both light and dark themes:

```dart
// Access the current theme
ThemeData get theme => ThemeHelper().themeData();

// Use colors
color: theme.colorScheme.primary,
```

## 📱 Responsive Design
The app is built with responsive design using the SizeUtils:

```dart
// Example of responsive sizing
Container(
  width: 50.h,
  height: 20.h,
  child: Text('Responsive Container'),
)
```
## 📦 Deployment
